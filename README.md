# Random Fantasy Map Generator V1
A colourful minimalistic random fantasy map generator written in C, that uses SDL.

Every map is randomly generated through multiple algorithms that iterate through the map pixel by pixel and assign each pixel values based on their latitude.
This is version 1 - I have future plans to add more features such as mountains, humidity, and a better colour blending algorithm. Please note, after 100 seconds the
autogenerated map will disappear forever, so make sure you screenshot it if you like your creation!

# How to use
For Windows:
1) Run make on the makefile in src, you'll likely have to use MingW
2) It should compile into a .exe that you can use

For Linux and OSX:
1) Run make on the makefile
2) It should compile into a .sh or runnable file

In the case that the user doesn't want to compile the program I've included a .exe that can run on windows. 
Just double click it!
